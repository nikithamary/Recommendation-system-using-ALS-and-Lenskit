# recommendation-system-using-ALS-and-Lenskit

In this project, we present the methods used to aggregate the interaction count data, create a popularity-based recommender system, and evaluate the performance of the system. Our preprocessing steps ensured that the data was clean and ready for analysis, while our evaluation metrics allowed us to assess the quality of the recommendations generated by the system. The performance of the recommender system increased with higher values of beta. As part of future work, we will explore other recommendation algorithms and techniques, as well as investigate methods to incorporate user and song metadata to enhance the quality of recommendations.
